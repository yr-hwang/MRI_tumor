# Qualitative & Quantitative Analysis of Structural MRI Modalities & Segmentation of Tumor Regions

This project was carried out to make a qualitative comparison between T1CE and T2 brain scans, segmentation of tumor regions within the images, and quantitative comparison of the tumor brain scans. 
The dataset consists of 1 T1CE image and 1 T2 image for the 2 visits to the hospital from 5 subjects each, adding up to a total of 20 images. The MRI images used are considered private and confidential, hence they will not be included in this repository.

## Qualitative Analysis

Firstly, tumor masks were made for each image using the ITK-SNAP program. The tumor masks were saved as binary masks.
